Reading file gromacs.tpr, VERSION 2021.3 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 20 to 50, rlist from 0.835 to 0.924

On host ishikawa 4 GPUs selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 4 GPU tasks in the 4 ranks on this node:
  PP:0,PP:1,PP:2,PP:3
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged and most bonded interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
Using 4 MPI threads
Using 5 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread


NOTE: DLB will not turn on during the first phase of PME tuning
starting mdrun ''
5000 steps,     10.0 ps.

NOTE: DLB can now turn on, when beneficial

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 4.1%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 53%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 2.2%.

GROMACS reminds you: "I have noticed a large, negative correlation between having a well-defined mission workload and concern for the Top500. It's almost like LINPACK is what you focus on when you don't know what to focus on." (Jeff Hammond)
